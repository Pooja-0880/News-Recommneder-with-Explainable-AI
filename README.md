# Deep Knowledge-Aware Network (DKN) for News Recommendation

## Abstract
This repository introduces the Deep Knowledge-Aware Network (DKN) augmented with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques for online news recommendation. The DKN model addresses transparency and user trust issues in existing recommendation systems by providing clearer and more understandable news recommendations. Integration of KCNN and attention modules enhances recommendation accuracy and personalization, validated through experiments showing improved explainability, user trust, and engagement.
